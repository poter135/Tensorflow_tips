## A.I. v.s. Machine learning v.s. Neural Network(Deep Learning)
- NN is a subset of ML, and ML is a subset of AI.

- ML is what generates algorithms automatically.
- NN is a process with layers, including input and output, and when the numbers of layers are more than 2, it names deep learning. 
## Machine Learing
- There are three types of ML:
    - Supervised learning - learning with input(features) and output(labels) data
    - Unsupervised learning - learning with only input data and expecting it generates the labels for us(often use in clustering)
    - reinforcement learning - using reward to train agent under the enviroment(often use in game)
